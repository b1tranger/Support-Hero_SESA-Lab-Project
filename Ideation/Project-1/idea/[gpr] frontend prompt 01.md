Here's an improved and clearer version of your prompt. It organizes the requirements for better readability, provides more design clarity, and uses more precise language to help a developer or designer better understand your vision:

**Prompt (Improved):**

I want to create a website for a project called **"Support System Site"**, based on the attached diagram. The project's goal is to connect consumers with service providers, allowing consumers to access services while providers are compensated through both direct compensation and donations received from consumers.

### Home Page Structure:

* The home page should consist of **full-screen sections**, each dedicated to a **core component** of the project.
* The **Hero section** will include:

  * A prominent background image
  * A call-to-action button that scrolls the user to the next section
* A **consistent navigation bar** should be present on all pages to improve user experience.

### Navigation Bar Design:

* **On desktop:**

  * The navigation bar should appear on the **left side** of the screen.
  * It should be **detached** from the screen edge with **margins** and a **border radius**, giving it a modern, floating look.

* **On mobile:**

  * The navigation bar should be positioned at the **bottom center**, directly **connected to the bottom screen borders** (i.e., flush with the edges, no margin).
  * It should be easily accessible with touch-friendly icons or buttons.

The site should be fully responsive and visually clean, ensuring easy navigation and a user-friendly layout on both desktop and mobile devices.

Let me know if you'd like me to turn this into a developer-ready spec or generate a sample layout/design for it.


###############################################################

Add a button besides "Learn More" called "Services" that takes the user to another page for logging in as the consumer or the service provider. This button should be shown on top when the user scrolls past it and tries to go below the hero Section. 



Add a few demo sections from the last section that will be used for some backend operations.

###############################################################

Use raw CSS, remove frameworks.



Align the "Services" to the right of the top bar (when the user scrolls out of the Hero Section and the Button moves to the top.)
